# NLP Team
The NLP Team, in collaboration with the [Crypto Team](https://github.com/OpenMined/Roadmap/tree/master/crypto_team), is on a mission to help bring privacy-preserving NLP to life. [SyferText](https://github.com/OpenMined/SyferText) is the library the team is currently building in an effort to create the first production-ready solution leveraging [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) to enable Natural Language Process that protects data and models' privacy.

## Roadmap (2020)

1. Building SyferText with production in mind.
  - Identifying at least three companies with a potential interest in using SyferText.
  - Building a collaboration around a real-world usecase with at least one company.

2. Focus on communication: OpenMined AMA, meetups, tutorials.

## Short-Term Goals 

Here are some of the main SyferText features we are working on currently:

1. Perform the first encrypted federated training of a logistic regression model on two remote datasets (subsets of SST-2). *(Before March 19th 2020)*

2. Validate that such concurrent training on two datasets can boost performance compared to pretraining on one and fine tuning on the other. *(Before March 19th 2020)*

3. The ability to add the trained model to a pipeline of models that operate an a document. *(Before March 19th 2020)*

4. The ability to dump/load a language model with all of its pipes to/from disk. *(Before May 13th 2020)*

## Joining the Team

If our roadmap gets you excited about SyferText and if you share our vision in building an NLP library that respects and protects data privacy, you can start contributing to any of OpenMined's [open source projects](https://github.com/OpenMined) (including SyferText). Once you merge your first PR in any of these projects,  you can apply to  join our team by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/1t5Bvj1FFpvFEt2P9).

## Building Collaborations

We, at the NLP team, are eager to learn about new real-world use-cases around which new features in SyferText could be built. 

If you think that SyferText, in its current state or by adding more features, could be useful to your project or company, please contact us as indicated below in the **Contact Us** section, and let us discuss how we can help.
