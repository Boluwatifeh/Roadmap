# Syft Core Team Roadmap

Welcome to the Syft Core Team's Roadmap! This repository contains our short term (weekly) and medium term (3 - 6 months) development plans. This team is responsible for the develpment of core Syft features which affect all (or most) users of PySyft and Syft-lite libraries. We primarily work on development of PySyft and syft-proto.

## Team Members

The team leader is [**Andrew Trask**](https://github.com/iamtrask). Our team is comprised of the following people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):

### Member Types: 

- **Full Member:** someone who is a permanent, experienced member of the team. They are expected to attend weekly meetings and push code every week. They will typically have a project of their own.
- **Learning Member:** someone who is new to the team, whose main role is to be spinning on the codebase, responsibilities, ongoing projects, and future roadmap for the team. New team recruits will typically be a learning member for the first 30 days of their team membership.
- **Guest Member:** someone who is temporarily "on-loan" from another team to work on a specific project.
- **Embedded Member:** someone who is actually a full member of a different team, but who is permanently "embedded" within our team to facilitate a specific long-term collaboration. For example, one team's member can be an embedded member in another team if there's always lots of cross-collab, such as a member of the writing team being an "embedded" member of they Syft Core team to manage code documentation efforts.

## Projects

[You can view the current projects we're working on here](./projects). Each project includes our roadmap for at least the next 6 months, divided into individual projects with high level descriptions, example code, and links to Issues and Pull Requests across OpenMined's repositories.

## Weekly Meetings

We have weekly meetings that are currently private, [but we take detailed notes for each meeting](./meetings). Here you can will find our weekly status updates: where each member of our team has recorded what they worked on the previous week and what they plan to work on in the upcoming week.
