**MIKE**

- Last week was about moving all translation stuff to PyGrid, so we don't need to worry about bundle size
- Added the logic in the Javascript library to PyGrid to ensure we can appropriately translate plans there
- Mostly working on putting everything in PySyft for now
- Will work on a Python test suite

**VOVA**

- Last week working on plan translation change to Torchscript
- Created 3 PR's to show the complete workflow rom PySyft to PyGrid to the worker
- Also looking into sending a dictionary into a plan instead of a list of arguments or tensors. This would make it easier to send model params.

**MADDIE**

- Last week worked on HSA and RSA version of JWT for PyGrid, merged!
- Need to hook up all the variables in the server_config
- Need to also hook up SQL alchemy as well

**VARUN**

- FL on Android is over, but not able to send the diff. Minor problems with serialization.
- Looking to create another diff plan to send back
- PyTorch has issues with mean and sum functions, it's a confirmed problem with PyTorch, and we're waiting to hear back
- Working on the plots for showing loss and accuracy rate, same as Javascript
