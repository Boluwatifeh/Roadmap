# Writing Team Roadmap

Welcome to the Writing Team's Roadmap! 


## Who are we? 
We are a group of volunteer writers from various backgrounds who are all interested in writing blog posts for the [**OpenMined blog**](https://blog.openmined.org/)! The group is led by Emma Bluemke (@Emma on slack). 

Our team is comprised of over 40 people located worldwide, from North America to Japan.

You can see our full team under [**OpenMined/Community/writing**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenMined/teams/writing)!

## What do we write? 

> “… A good start would be to **recognize within yourself the ability to understand anything**, because that ability is there **as long as it’s explained clearly enough**. And then go and ask for explanations.
>And if you’re thinking right now, ‘What do I ask for?’ Ask yourself if there is anything in your life that you want changed… That’s where to start.” 
_James Burke_


We produce a range of material for the OpenMined community - for example, blog posts can be [announcements](https://blog.openmined.org/pytorch-grant-recipients/), [interviews](https://blog.openmined.org/openmined-featured-contributor-november-2019/), [code demos](https://blog.openmined.org/encrypted-training-on-mnist/) and/or [tutorials](https://blog.openmined.org/training-cnns-using-spdz/), or [journalism style pieces](https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-differential-privacy-and-encrypted-computation-for-medical-imaging/) about privacy and topics of interest to the OpenMined community.

_**Note:** Please don't be shy if you don't feel 'technical enough' - we want social & political scientists, STS researchers, philosophers, and more to join our community and join the discussions around privacy technology. We welcome your skillset._

## I'm ready to start writing! What should I work on?

We are always looking for writers! We produce a huge range of material, so as long as you like writing and privacy, we welcome your skillset and domain knowledge. 

**The blog ideas and suggestions are added to this:**
- [**Project Board for Code Demos**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenMined/projects/32)
- [**Project Board for Long Form Blogs and Announcements**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenMined/projects/30)
- [**Project Board for Privacy Teaching Series**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenMined/projects/31)

These boards are where everything happens! Bookmark them.

Once you're a member of the writing team, you can use those boards to suggest new blog post ideas, claim unclaimed blog post ideas (by assigning it to yourself on github), and give updates on your progress. You'll also be able to view what everyone else is working on, and see examples of previous posts. 

“Many hands make light work” - if you see something that someone else is working on that you really want to help with, send them a message and offer your help! Our team has grown really quickly and it's large now, so you can be as busy as you'd like (writing all the time) or just write something every once in a while, there's no pressure.
