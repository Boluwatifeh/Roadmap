# PyDP Team Roadmap

The value of compute and analysis over joint private data sets for academic research and innovation in the private sector is high. The complexity of the required tools, performance trade-offs and difficulty in quantifiably measuring the risk of re-identification too often act as roadblocks for these activities.

*Team DP will lower the barrier of entry by creating intuitive and powerful tools that work with industry standard frameworks. We will champion the adoption of these tools through creation and compilation of easy to follow resources and documentation.*

Welcome to the PyDP Team's Roadmap! This repository contains our short term (weekly) and medium term (3 - 6 months) development plans. This team is responsible for the development and adoption of tools related to privacy that can be incorporated into the OpenMined ecosystem.

## Team Members

The team leader is [**Benjamin Szymkow**](https://github.com/simcof). Our team is comprised of the following people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):

### Member Types: 

- **Full Member:** someone who is a permanent, experienced member of the team. They are expected to attend weekly meetings and push code every week. They will typically have a project of their own.
- **Learning Member:** someone who is new to the team, whose main role is to be spinning on the codebase, responsibilities, ongoing projects, and future roadmap for the team. New team recruits will typically be a learning member for the first 30 days of their team membership.
- **Guest Member:** someone who is temporarily "on-loan" from another team to work on a specific project.
- **Embedded Member:** someone who is actually a full member of a different team, but who is permanently "embedded" within our team to facilitate a specific long-term collaboration. For example, one team's member can be an embedded member in another team if there's always lots of cross-collab, such as a member of the writing team being an "embedded" member of Team DP to manage code documentation efforts.

## Projects

We have one project active:

[PyDP](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP) - a python API for Google's differential privacy library

## Weekly Meetings

We have weekly meetings that are currently private. We will soon start taking notes and publishing them.

## Support

For support in using this library, please join the **#lib_pydp** Slack channel. If youâ€™d like to follow along with any code changes to the library, please join the **#code_roadmap** Slack channel. [Click here to join our Slack community!](https://slack.openmined.org)
